HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The prediction of house prices has garnered substantial interest in both academia and industry due to its significant implications for the real estate market. This study proposes a comprehensive machine learning approach for predicting house prices based on a diverse set of features including property attributes, location data, and macroeconomic indicators. 

The research employs various regression techniques such as linear regression, support vector machines, and random forests to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate house prices. Additionally, feature engineering and selection methodologies are integrated to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models and mitigate the impact of multicollinearity. 
The dataset used in this study encompasses a wide range of geographical locations, enabling the models to capture regional variations and specific market dynamics. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated through rigorous cross-validation techniques and evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. 

The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the machine learning models in accurately predicting house prices, thereby providing valuable insights for real estate investors, homeowners, and policymakers to make informed decisions in the dynamic housing market. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by showcasing the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques in addressing complex real estate valuation challenges and offers practical implications for stakeholders in the real estate sector.
